# my-first-webscraper
This is my first webscraper. It is a demo on how to use the **requests** and **BeautifulSoup** modules to parse
and extract data from an e-commerce site with multple categories, subcategories loaded in multiple pages.
This script scrapes product details on http://webscrape.io/test-sites/e-commerce/static/computers/laptops.
It then prints the gathered data on screen and saves it to a csv file.
